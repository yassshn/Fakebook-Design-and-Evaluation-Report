## Introduction

Fakebook is a secure social media platform emphasizing privacy and security in user interactions. The platform integrates end-to-end encryption
(E2EE) and advanced security protocols to protect user data from unauthorized access, eavesdropping, and other cyber threats. This report evaluates 
these measures, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes solutions to ensure Fakebook remains a trusted communication tool.

## Cybersecurity Threats

The report identifies and ranks the following key threats to the platform:
- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Risk of exposing sensitive user information like messages and personal details.
- **Data Interception and Eavesdropping**: Attacks targeting communication confidentiality.
- **Account Takeover**: Unauthorized access through compromised credentials.
- **Service Disruption (DDoS)**: Overloading servers to disrupt user access.
- **SQL Injection and Message Replay**: Exploiting system vulnerabilities and reusing old messages to deceive users.
- **Insider Threats**: Potential misuse of access by administrators or cloud providers.
- **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Manipulation tactics to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.

---

## Security Protocols

The report recommends the integration of the following security protocols:
1. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Ensures only intended recipients can decrypt messages.
2. **TLS/SSL**: Encrypts data transmission between clients and servers to protect against interception.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized account access.
4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages data access permissions based on user roles.
5. **Regular Security Audits and Logging**: Monitors for anomalies, assesses risks, and ensures compliance.

## Attacker Model and Mitigation

### Adversary Capabilities
- Intercepting communications.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Slowloris attacks.
- Compromising user accounts through phishing or brute force.

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Against Data Interception**: E2EE and TLS protect data in transit.
2. **Against SQL Injection**: Input validation and prepared statements mitigate vulnerabilities.
3. **Against Service Disruption**: Load balancers, reverse proxies, and connection limits protect against Slowloris attacks.
4. **Against Unauthorized Access**: MFA and robust access control prevent account compromise.

---

## Recommendations

To strengthen the platform's security:
- Fully implement **E2EE** for all message types, including subgroup communications.
- Enhance anomaly detection to identify potential attacks early.
- Conduct **regular penetration tests** to identify emerging vulnerabilities.
- Educate users about phishing and secure password practices.
